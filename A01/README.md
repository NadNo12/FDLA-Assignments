# A01 - Event Feed

## Description

This is our solution for the first assignment, containing three routes. The first route is serving the event form an displays existing events using the GET method. The second route adds a new event when using the POST method. The third route renders the events as an ATOM feed. 

The application is using the Bun JavaScript runtime due to its integrated SQLite functionality, as well as the ElysiaJS web framework, and EtaJS for template rendering. For CSS purposes Water.CSS is used and referenced.
